This repository is reserved to my final project for my IBM agile course

FINAL PROJECT SCENARIO  

In this scenario, you will play the roles of a product owner, scrum master, and developer. As a product owner, you will create stories for your team and organize these stories into a product backlog. As a scrum master, you will create a sprint milestone and make sure that a subset of the stories is ready to be placed in a sprint plan. As a developer, you will create the sprint backlog and execute some of the stories by moving them across the kanban board in a simulated sprint. 

Your team has been asked to develop the backend product catalog for an e-commerce website. Your stakeholders need the ability to create products, retrieve products, update products, and delete products from the catalog. They have also asked for the ability for customers to indicate that they "like a product and have the site display the like count on the product page.” In addition to the catalog functionality, they have asked that it be hosted on a cloud environment with automated deployments. 

Your team will use ZenHub to provide a kanban board to create a backlog and sprint plan for this work. As the product owner, you will be driving the process. You need to leverage the skills you learned in the lessons and labs to create a new GitHub repository and ZenHub kanban board and fill the kanban board with issues that will become your user stories. 
ZENHUB  

For this project, you will use ZenHub and GitHub in the same way that you did for the labs. You will create a new GitHub repository and a ZenHub kanban board.
